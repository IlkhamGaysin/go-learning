# My learning path of Go
I'm learning Go by the [following course](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide/) and I'm using this repository to keep track of my progress. This covers a Simple Start section of the course.

# Usage
To run the code, you need to have Go installed. Then, you can run the code by typing `go run main.go` in the terminal.
You can also compile the code by typing `go build` in the terminal. This will create an executable file that you can run by typing `./main` in the terminal.
